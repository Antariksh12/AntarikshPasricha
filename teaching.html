        <p class="title">
            “I firmly believe that interdisciplinary teaching is the most effective way of learning. Over the years, I
            have witnessed firsthand how connecting music with other disciplines—like science, mathematics, language,
            and even sports—dramatically accelerates learning.”
        </p>
        <ul class="secret">
            <li class="secret">Incorporating language and literature into music—through composing lyrics, interpreting
                poetry, or analyzing phrasing—enhances creativity, comprehension, and expressive skills. Even physical
                activities, such as using basketball dribbles to explain rhythm patterns, help students internalize
                beats and timing through bodily movement, making learning intuitive and memorable.</li>

            <li class="secret pink">The result? Concepts that might take a year to learn traditionally are often grasped
                in just a few months. Students not only retain knowledge better but also develop analytical thinking,
                creativity, and confidence, seeing music as a living, logical, and expressive art form rather than just
                notes on a page.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="secret">And so, with her vocal cords never fully healed, Aimer continues to sing.</p>

            “She possesses an extremely rare voice in which amplitude fluctuation and frequency fluctuation occur
            simultaneously.”
            --- Former Director of the Japan Acoustic Research Institute, Matsumi Suzuki
        </p>

        <h2 class="pink">Taka (ONE OK ROCK):</h2>
        <p class="comment">
            “From the day I first heard her voice and was moved, up until offering her this song (insane dream), we
            talked, experimented, and created together many times.
            During the recording, I was repeatedly surprised by her talent as a singer, and I think this song became a
            new challenge for Aimer as well.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            This session came from my simple desire for this wonderful artist’s music to reach more people, and it
            became a wonderful time in which I was also inspired!”
        </p>

        <h2 class="pink">TK (from Ling tosite sigure):</h2>
        <p class="comment">“Aimer possesses a mysterious magic—melodies are born from her voice, and words are drawn
            toward it.”</p>
        <p class="comment">“As if her voice already knew the destination, I simply added a little to the map, and we
            arrived somewhere no one had ever seen.”</p>
        <p class="comment">“Thank you for opening the door to the sounds inside me that I could never let out. I hope
            this reaches many people.”</p>

        <h2 class="pink">Yojiro Noda (RADWIMPS):</h2>
        <p class="comment">
            “I think it was three or four years ago when I first heard Aimer’s voice. A friend happened to give me a CD.
            Just from her voice, I found myself liking her without even knowing her.
            Listening to her sing repeatedly during the recording made me happy, and I’m glad she sang this important
            song.”
        </p>
        <p class="comment">“Thank you, Aimer.”</p>

        <h2 class="pink">Takahito Uchisawa (androp):</h2>
        <p class="comment">
            “When we first entered the studio, I was amazed and moved that she created her entire world with just a
            simple ‘La la la.’
            Wanting to break her world a little, I poured in the desires I had always wanted to express but couldn’t.
            She accepted everything, and instead of breaking, she created a new form and gave it back.
            I was happy to be there in the moment when a new Aimer was born.
            I want as many people as possible to feel this emotion.”
